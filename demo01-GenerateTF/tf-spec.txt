Generate a Terraform configuration script compatible with Terraform 1.5+ to provision an AWS EC2 instance with the following specifications:
- Instance type: `t3.micro`
- AWS region: `us-east-1`
- AMI: `Amazon Linux 2023` (ensure the AMI ID is specific to the `us-east-1` region and up-to-date)
- Key pair: `my-key-pair` (assume this key pair already exists in the `us-east-1` region)
- Security group: Configure a security group that allows inbound SSH traffic on port 22 from any IP address (CIDR block `0.0.0.0/0`).

Ensure the output includes the instance's public IP address. Provide the code only, without any additional explanation or comments.
Use the following example of Terraform syntax as a guide for formatting:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```
