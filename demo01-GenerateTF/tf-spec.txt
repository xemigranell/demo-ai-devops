Generate a Terraform configuration script compatible with Terraform 1.5+ and azurerm version <4 to provision an Azure VM with the following specifications:
- SKU: `Standard_B1s`
- Region: `westeurope`
- Resource group: `rg001`
- Image: `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS`
- ssh key: `my-key-pair` (assume this key pair already exists and is stored in keyvault kvt001 in the same resource group in the `westeurope` region)
- Network security group: Configure a network security group that allows inbound SSH traffic on port 22 from any IP address (CIDR block 0.0.0.0/0). Ensure the output includes the VM's public IP address.
Ensure the output includes the instance's public IP address. Provide the code only, without any additional explanation or comments.
